### **_MultipleLinearRegression_**
A linear regression model that contains more than one predictor variable is called a multiple linear regression model. It is basically the same as Simple Linear regression, but with more predictor variables (features). The idea is that linearly related predictor variables can approximate the labels with a 'best fitted' hyperplane or surface. The model assumes:
  1. Linearity
  2. Homoscedasticity
  3. Multivariate normality
  4. Independence of errors
  5. Lack of multicollinearity
