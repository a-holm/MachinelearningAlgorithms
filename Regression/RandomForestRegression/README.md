### **_RandomForestRegression_**
Random forest algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm. As the name suggest, this algorithm creates the forest with a number of decision trees.

In general, the more trees in the forest the more robust the forest looks like. In the same way in the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest gives the high accuracy results.
