# MachinelearningAlgorithms
Python examples of machine learning . All examples are shown by using conventional libraries and by building the algorithms from scratch.
Each algorithm has it's own folder and includes two types of python files:

### ~{ Currently making and updating, expect to see new activity the coming days.}~ 

  1. Files that start with the prefix *"regular"* ( for example, `regularLinearRegression.py` ) are machine learning algorithms with conventional libraries, APIs and built-in logic. These are to show that I can be effective with the libraries currently available.
  2. Files that start with the prefix *"howItWorks"* ( for example, `howItWorksLinearRegression.py` ) are machine learning algorithms that are built **from scratch** and shows that I understand these algorithms.
