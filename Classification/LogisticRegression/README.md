### **_LogisticRegression_**
In statistics, logistic regression, or logit regression, or logit model is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical. This project covers the case of a binary dependent variableâ€”that is, where it can take only two values, "0" and "1", which represent outcomes such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. 

The binary Logistic regression model is an example of a qualitative response/discrete choice model. It is used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or independent) variables (features).
