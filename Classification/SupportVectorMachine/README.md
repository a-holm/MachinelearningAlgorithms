### **_SupportVectorMachine_** 
Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. The objective of the SVM is to find the best separating hyperplane in vector space which is also referred to as the decision boundary.

The algorithm coded from scratch is a bare-bones and simple implementation to mainly show the thinking clearly without adding a lot of other elements. This algorithm can only take linearly separable data that does not overlap. For a more advanced implementation with overlapping and non-linear data see the folder **KernelSVM**.
