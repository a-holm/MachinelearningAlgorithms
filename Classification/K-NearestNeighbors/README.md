### **_K-NearestNeighbors_** 
The K-nearest neighbors algorithm is a method used for classification and regression. The idea of K Nearest Neighbors classification is to best divide and separate the data based on clustering the data and to classify based on the proximity to it's K closest neighbors and their classifications. Where 'k' is the number of neighbors that are involved in the classification.
