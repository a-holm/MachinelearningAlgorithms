# Model Selection Boosting algorithms and projects
Python examples of Model Selection Boosting. Each algorithm has it's own folder.

By making the algorithms from scratch I hope to show that I do not only know how to use the algorithms, but I also understand how it functions. By using conventional libraries for machine learning I hope to show that I can be effective and take advantage of the high-performance backend of libraries like for example, Scikit-learn and Tensorflow.

Folder names are **bolded** while filenames are `highlighted` for readability.

## FOLDER CONTENTS (in alphabetical order):

### **_GradientBoostingWithXGBoost_**
Currently empty, check back soon for updates.

### **_ModelSelection_**
Currently empty, check back soon for updates.
